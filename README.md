# üå¨Ô∏è Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction

## üìå Project Overview & Task Objective

This notebook addresses the severe air pollution issue in Delhi by developing a machine learning model to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI). The objective is to leverage historical data on various pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO‚ÇÇ, etc.) to build and evaluate regression models. The ultimate goal is to understand key pollution trends and enable early warnings through data-driven AQI forecasting.

## üìÇ Dataset Information

The project utilizes historical air quality data for Delhi, which typically includes measurements of various pollutants and the corresponding AQI. The dataset would contain features such as `City`, `Date`, `PM2.5`, `PM10`, `NO`, `NO2`, `NOx`, `NH3`, `CO`, `SO2`, `O3`, `Benzene`, `Toluene`, `Xylene`, `AQI`, and `AQI_Bucket`.

**Key Aspects:**
- Time-series data of air pollutant concentrations.
- Regression problem to predict AQI.
- Requires handling of missing values and potentially time-based feature engineering.

## ‚ú® Features

- Data loading and initial inspection.
- Handling missing values through imputation or removal.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand pollutant distributions and trends.
- Feature engineering from date/time information.
- Training and evaluating various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To run this notebook locally, you will need Python installed along with the following libraries. You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## üöÄ Approach

My approach to AQI prediction involved the following steps:

- **Library Import**: Imported essential Python libraries for data manipulation (pandas, numpy), visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), and machine learning (sklearn).
  
- **Data Loading**: Loaded the air quality dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
  - Identified and handled missing values in pollutant concentration columns.
  - Converted `Date` column to datetime objects and extracted time-based features (e.g., month, day of week).
    
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Analyzed the distribution of AQI and individual pollutants.
  - Explored temporal trends of pollutants and AQI.
  - Visualized relationships between different pollutants and AQI.
  
- **Model Training and Testing**:
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Trained multiple regression models, such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, to predict AQI.

- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the trained models using regression metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score to assess their predictive performance.

## üìâ Visualizations

### Pollutants Over Time

**Insights:**
PM2.5 and PM10 spike in winters (Nov‚ÄìJan) O3 and SO2 are less volatile Strong seasonal trends observed

### Correlation between Pollutants and AQI
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86f93bc8-07a2-4d37-be7a-676b58a81318)

**Insights:**
AQI is highly correlated with PM2.5 (0.94) and PM10 (0.89) Moderate correlation with NO, NO2, CO O3 and SO2 have weaker correlation ‚úÖ Why: Guides feature selection ‚Äî strong predictors help model accuracy.

### Actual vs Predicted AQI

**Insights:**
- Random Forest closely follows actual AQI
- Linear regression misses peaks and drops
- Confirms that AQI behavior is non-linear

## üìä Results and Insights

- PM2.5 and PM10 are the most significant contributors to AQI levels.
- Seasonal patterns were observed, with higher AQI in winter months.
- Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression, effectively capturing the non-linear relationships between   pollutants and AQI.
- Random Forest showed better generalization and more accurate AQI classification.
- Models are effective for real-time AQI forecasting and can support alert systems for public health         monitoring.
