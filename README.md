# 🌬️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview & Task Objective

This notebook addresses the severe air pollution issue in Delhi by developing a machine learning model to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI). The objective is to leverage historical data on various pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, etc.) to build and evaluate regression models. The ultimate goal is to understand key pollution trends and enable early warnings through data-driven AQI forecasting.

## 📂 Dataset Information

The project utilizes historical air quality data for Delhi, which typically includes measurements of various pollutants and the corresponding AQI. The dataset would contain features such as `City`, `Date`, `PM2.5`, `PM10`, `NO`, `NO2`, `NOx`, `NH3`, `CO`, `SO2`, `O3`, `Benzene`, `Toluene`, `Xylene`, `AQI`, and `AQI_Bucket`.

**Key Aspects:**
- Time-series data of air pollutant concentrations.
- Regression problem to predict AQI.
- Requires handling of missing values and potentially time-based feature engineering.

## ✨ Features

- Data loading and initial inspection.
- Handling missing values through imputation or removal.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand pollutant distributions and trends.
- Feature engineering from date/time information.
- Training and evaluating various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.

## 🛠️ Installation

To run this notebook locally, you will need Python installed along with the following libraries. You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 Approach

My approach to AQI prediction involved the following steps:

- **Library Import**: Imported essential Python libraries for data manipulation (pandas, numpy), visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), and machine learning (sklearn).
  
- **Data Loading**: Loaded the air quality dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
  - Identified and handled missing values in pollutant concentration columns.
  - Converted `Date` column to datetime objects and extracted time-based features (e.g., month, day of week).
    
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Analyzed the distribution of AQI and individual pollutants.
  - Explored temporal trends of pollutants and AQI.
  - Visualized relationships between different pollutants and AQI.
  
- **Model Training and Testing**:
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Trained multiple regression models, such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, to predict AQI.

- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the trained models using regression metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score to assess their predictive performance.
